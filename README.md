# 🧠 Resume Website using Express.js

This project demonstrates how to host a personal Resume Website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript using Node.js and Express.js.
It’s a simple yet effective setup to serve static web pages through a backend server.

# 🚀 Features

🌐 Serves your resume website through an Express.js server

⚡ Fast and lightweight — perfect for hosting portfolios or personal sites

📄 Supports all static assets (HTML, CSS, JS, images)

🧱 Clean folder structure for easy scalability

💬 Can be extended with form handling or routing features

# 🛠️ Technologies Used
Technology	Purpose
HTML5	Structure and content of the resume
CSS3	Styling and responsive layout
JavaScript (Vanilla)	Interactive sections and dynamic behavior
Node.js	Runtime environment
Express.js	Backend framework to serve static files

# ⚙️ How It Works
The project uses Express.js to handle incoming HTTP requests.

It serves all static files (like index.html, CSS, and JS) from a public directory.

When a user visits the server URL (like http://localhost:3000),
the Express app responds with your resume’s homepage.
